## Stream validation

Currently JetProbe supports only validation of component properties. This feature would enable the developers to test the incoming/outgoing streaming stored in RabbitMQ and Kafka.

## Spark Connector

Spark connector would enable the user to validate the Spark Job configuration and the status at any point of time. It can validate the cluster resources being used by the job, the job status, the applicaton name and other job specific configurations.

## ES & Solr Connector
Connectors for Solr and Elasticsearch would enable the developers to validate the schema of the index, index properties, documents in the index and also the cluster specific properties of the Search Engine.
